# Zhaojin Chu's Website

My personal site is built on top of the al-folio Jekyll template, a clean and responsive theme designed for academic portfolios. The theme's layouts for CVs, publications, and projects make it easy to keep my work organized while still letting me tailor the look and content to my needs.

I customize the configuration and content files in this repository to publish research highlights, project notes, and other updates. Everything here powers the live site on GitHub Pages.
