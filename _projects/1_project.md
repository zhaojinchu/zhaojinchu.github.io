Built a custom 8-bit CPU at a 3-week intensive course at the Center for Talented Development at Northwestern University. Working with Windy City labs, I designed custom schematics and internal components and programmed a custom assembly language.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
