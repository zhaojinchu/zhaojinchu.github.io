profile_summary: Built Logic Labs curriculum and electronics kits, integrating the program into Dubai College's GCSE curriculum.

Logic Labs started as a passion project and grew into a turnkey hardware curriculum now rolling into Dubai Collegeâ€™s GCSE classrooms. I designed the kits, wrote the lesson plans, and built an online companion so students can learn digital logic by soldering, simulating, and debugging real circuits.

**Program design**
- Modular lessons that progress from transistor fundamentals to combinational logic, flip-flops, and simple state machines.
- Instructor playbooks with pacing guides, troubleshooting matrices, and assessment rubrics to slot seamlessly into school timetables.
- Online portal hosting animations, challenge problems, and quiz banks so students can self-pace between lab sessions.

**Hardware platform**
- Custom PCBs featuring swappable gate modules, probe points, and power-safe headers that survive classroom abuse.
- Component bins standardised around breadboard-friendly packages, encouraging experimentation without overwhelming new builders.
- Lab instrumentation cheatsheets that teach students how to use multimeters and oscilloscopes while they verify their builds.

**Impact & rollout**
- Piloted with the Head of Computer Science to align with GCSE outcomes and gather iterative feedback from early cohorts.
- Built teacher onboarding workshops covering kit setup, safety, and how to debug common mistakes in under ten minutes per group.
- Tracking student engagement metrics through the portal so future cohorts get data-driven updates to exercises and video content.

Next up: release a public kit run and add microcontroller extension labs for students who master the basics early.
