profile_summary: Combined a custom YOLOv5 detector with histogram-boosted preprocessing and ONNX OCR to read plates end-to-end.
---

This project stitches detection, pre-processing, and OCR into a single script that reads license plates from noisy street captures. I fine-tuned YOLOv5 on a Kaggle dataset, layered in histogram/threshold filters, and integrated Fast Plate OCR to land text predictions with high recall. Repo here: [github.com/zhaojinchu/YolovLicensePlateRecognition](https://github.com/zhaojinchu/YolovLicensePlateRecognition).

**Pipeline overview**
- YOLOv5 detector localises plates, with weights saved under `outputs/train/license_detection2/weights/best.pt`.
- Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation plus adaptive thresholding stabilise plates before OCR.
- Fast Plate OCR (ONNX) decodes characters and feeds annotated outputs back into the final imagery.

**Training setup**
- Wrapped Ultralyticsâ€™ training loop with `train_yolov.py` so I can re-run experiments with new datasets or hyperparameters.
- Dataset YAML + preprocessed YOLO splits ship in-repo, making it easy to swap in custom data.
- GPU-friendly requirements lock to Python 3.12.7 + CUDA 12.4 wheels, with CPU fallbacks when needed.

**Deployment notes**
- Inference script batches through `preprocessed_dataset/images/test`, saving annotated results and streaming predictions to stdout.
- Config flags expose detection confidence, weight paths, and output directories for quick experimentation.
- Packaging advice covers ONNX/OpenCV dependencies so the pipeline stays portable across dev machines.

Next up: wire the detector into a live video stream and benchmark latency with TensorRT for real-time edge deployments.
